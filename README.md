✨ Hi! I'm @magacile and I'm here to learn a lot about coding and to work
with my bros! Who knows, I might get to be teaching something nice too! ✨

I study engineering and I still don't know what I'm doing with my life, but
I'm learning about how to create an API in Python and I'm an indie game en-
thusiast, so... Might be interested about coding game stuff also. Have a lot
of plans and still need a lot of skills to actually do them. Let's go then ✨

This README.md file is ✨TO BE UPDATED✨ as I post new stuff around. But I
have no plans yet. Thank you for reading <3
